## Hi, I'm Farzan - Triple F 🤘

Yeah, it's me! A guy who just wants to change the world. I don’t know how yet, but I’m seriously trying.

Right now, I'm working with programming languages, web development, and all that cool stuff to make small but meaningful improvements. I'm continuesly preparing myself for bigger challenges, not just a routine 9-5 job for the rest of my life.

Feel free to connect with me, I have only one prerequisite:  you’ve got that gut feeling that you can change the world too 😉

- 🔭 I’m currently working on frontend, frontend bro!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Backend, the whole process of web development.
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on talented open-source projects and new brilliant ideas,
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm originally an electronic engineer, super eager to build hardwares!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a metalhead
